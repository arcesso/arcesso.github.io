I made a blog, or, you know, stole one and then edited all the other content away.  Check out [Barry Clark's smashing Github Pages with Jekyll tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) for a quick and easy way to easily steal a blog and then edit it to make it your own.  It is kind of like stealing a bike and then repainting it, but the main difference is Barry actually wants you to steal his ~~bike~~, erm, blog thing.

I currently work nights in Washington state as a systems administrator and focus my talents on automation and infosec so I will likely blog about those often.  I don't have much experience with web development so this should be a fun learning experience.  While I generally don't have much to say, the purpose of this blog is to help me document some of the things I do so that I can offload my memory to a more perminent location, which can hopefully help others, and to start discussions about things that I find interesting.  Say 'hi' to me on Twitter or just check out some of the things I post.  A link can be found below.
