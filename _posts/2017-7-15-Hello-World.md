I made a blog, or, you know, stole one and then edited all the other content away.  Check out [Barry Clark's smashing Github Pages with Jekyll tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) for a quick and easy way to easily steal a blog and then edit it to make it your own.  It is kind of like stealing a bike and then repainting it, but the main difference is Barry actually wants you to steal his ~~bike~~, erm, blog thing.

I am a systems administrator and don't have much experience with web development so this should be fun and a good learning experience and will hopefully help me understand web stuff a little better.  I am making this to document some of the things I do so that I can remember and to archive and talk about things that I find interesting.
